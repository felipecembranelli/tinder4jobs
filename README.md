Tinder App for Windows Phone
======

Tinder is a cool iPhone/Android app and I thought it would be great to have it on Windows Phone.  This project is the result of about two nights of work on bringing the app to Windows Phone.  The app is now fully functional, but still is a bit rough around the edges.  This is definitely not an example of my best code.  I had no intention of open-sourcing this when I started, but I thought that some other Windows Phone developers out there might find it interesting, so here it is, freely licensed, do whatever you'd like with it.
